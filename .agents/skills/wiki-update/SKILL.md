  Sync the current project's knowledge into the Obsidian wiki. Use this skill from any project
  when the user says "update wiki", "sync to wiki", "save this to my wiki", "update obsidian",
  or wants to distill what they've been working on into their knowledge base. This is the
  cross-project skill that lets you push knowledge from wherever you are into the vault. Accepts
  inline named-vault routing like "@work update wiki" via the shared Config Resolution Protocol.

# Wiki Update — Sync Any Project to Your Wiki

You are distilling knowledge from the current project into the user's Obsidian wiki. This skill works from any project directory, not just the obsidian-wiki repo.
## Capability Boundary

**Input** — The current project, its source evidence (working tree, relevant docs, and decision-bearing commits), the resolved vault, and the prior project manifest entry. Load only bounded project context plus targeted existing pages, `index.md`, and recent `hot.md`; do not inherit unrelated campaign or project artifact groups.

**Work** — `wiki-update` owns the project delta, evidence-backed distillation, project-page destination selection, and cross-links. The parent objective remains “sync this project”; read-only helpers such as `code-understand` return focus evidence, while page/craft owners receive only the cited claims, target path, and applicable template conventions.

**Done** — With meaningful changes, close only after each created or updated page satisfies its output contract and scoped validation, then finalize tracking once: one project manifest `upsert`, one `index.md` update, one `log.md` entry, and one bounded `hot.md` rewrite. Run one QMD refresh after those writes and verify one affected page with search followed by `qmd get`/`multi-get`. With no meaningful delta, report unchanged and perform no writes or refresh. Any failed guard ends with a specific blocker and evidence, not a success claim based on prose.

**Capability Handoff** — Return focus-map/source citations, destination pages, and scoped validation evidence to the parent sync. `wiki-update` owns project tracking and QMD finalization; a delegated read or craft capability owns only its bounded operation and returns evidence before the sync resumes.


## Before You Start

1. **Resolve config** — follow the Config Resolution Protocol in AGENTS.md (inline `@name` override → walk up CWD for `.env` → `~/.obsidian-wiki/config` → prompt setup). This gives `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`, `OBSIDIAN_WIKI_REPO`, `OBSIDIAN_LINK_FORMAT` (`wikilink` default or `markdown`), and optional QMD settings such as `QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION`. Works from any project directory.
3. Check prior sync with `python3 scripts/manifest.py` (`stats` / `has` / `get`) on `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` — do **not** read whole `.manifest.json`.
4. Read `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/index.md` to know what the wiki already contains.

When writing internal links in Steps 4–5, apply the link format from `llm-wiki/SKILL.md` (Link Format section) using the `OBSIDIAN_LINK_FORMAT` value.

## Step 1: Understand the Project

Figure out what this project is by scanning the current working directory:

- `README.md`, docs/, any markdown files
- Source structure (frameworks, languages, key abstractions)
- `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml` or whatever defines the project
- Git log (focus on commit messages that signal decisions, not "fix typo" stuff)
- Claude memory files if they exist (`.claude/` in the project)

Derive a clean project name from the directory name.

## Step 2: Compute the Delta

Check this project via `python3 scripts/manifest.py has`/`get` (not a whole-file read):

- **First time?** Full scan. Everything is new.
- **Synced before?** Look at `last_commit_synced`. Before computing the delta, verify the stored SHA is still reachable:
  ```bash
  git merge-base --is-ancestor <last_commit_synced> HEAD
  ```
  - **Exit 0 (ancestor):** Safe. Run `git log <last_commit_synced>..HEAD --oneline` to see what changed.
  - **Exit 1 (not an ancestor — rebase or force-push occurred):** The stored SHA is no longer in this branch's history. Warn the user: *"Stored commit `<sha>` is no longer reachable — branch may have been rebased or force-pushed. Falling back to full scan."* Then treat as first-time sync: re-scan everything and update `last_commit_synced` to the current HEAD SHA at the end of Step 6.

If nothing meaningful changed since last sync, tell the user and stop.

## Step 3: Decide What to Distill

This is the core question from Karpathy's pattern: **what would you want to know about this project if you came back in 3 months with zero context?**

Worth distilling:

- Architecture decisions and *why* they were made
- Patterns discovered while building (things you'd Google again otherwise)
- What tools, services, APIs the project depends on and how they're wired together
- Key abstractions, how they connect, what the mental model is
- Trade-offs that were evaluated, what was picked and why
- Things learned while building that aren't obvious from reading the code

Not worth distilling:

- File listings, boilerplate, config that's obvious
- Individual bug fixes with no broader lesson
- Dependency versions, lock file contents
- Implementation details the code already says clearly
- Routine changes anyone could read from the diff

The heuristic: **if reading the codebase answers the question, don't wiki it. If you'd have to re-derive the reasoning by reading git blame across 20 commits, wiki it.**

### Step 3b: Build a code-understanding focus map (optional)

**GUARD: If the `obsidian-wiki code-understand` command fails or is unavailable, skip this step and continue — it is an optimisation, not a requirement.**

When this project contains code, run the local code-understanding extractor before distilling. It parses the codebase locally and returns a focus map — the ranked files and symbols the architecture hangs on — so you read the load-bearing parts instead of scanning everything.

```bash
obsidian-wiki code-understand --project "$(pwd)" --pretty
```

When this is not the first sync (Step 2 computed `last_commit_synced`), seed the focus map from the delta:

```bash
obsidian-wiki code-understand --project "$(pwd)" --since <last_commit_synced> --pretty
```

(First sync: omit `--since`.)

#### What to do with the focus-map output

1. **Read the output selectively** — when `backend: codegraph`, treat focus-map entries as structural facts with `file:line` citations; when `backend: builtin`, treat `defines`/`imports` entries as facts but treat `rg-reference` entries as weaker evidence — open the file and verify before citing. Open only the ranked `files`/`file:lines` the focus map points at; never paste the JSON into the wiki or the vault.
2. **Cite the evidence** — every architectural claim written to a page references its evidence as `(file:lines)` from the focus map or from the opened source; keep using the existing provenance markers.
3. **Prune stale relationships (required)** — when updating an existing `projects/<name>/` page, cross-check each previously recorded code relationship against the current focus map (or `obsidian-wiki ast-extract` for a symbol-level recheck). Remove relationships whose target symbol no longer exists or is no longer reachable; update the page and record the removals in `log.md`. This keeps false positives from accumulating.
4. **Never** write `.codegraph/` or the `code-understand` JSON into `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` — the graph is a cache/sidecar in the project repo, not wiki knowledge.
5. **Offer CodeGraph when it's missing (optional)** — if the output reports `backend: builtin` because codegraph is unavailable and the user wants the enhanced backend, offer to install it for them: `npm install -g @colbymchenry/codegraph` (or set `CODE_UNDERSTANDING_CODEGRAPH_BIN` to an existing binary), then re-run this step so the focus map uses the graph. Never install without the user's go-ahead, and never let a missing codegraph block the sync.

If `obsidian-wiki` is not installed or the command fails, skip this step and proceed to Step 4 as normal — it is an optimisation, not a requirement.

## Step 4: Distill into Wiki Pages

### Project-specific knowledge

Goes under `$VAULT/projects/<project-name>/`:

```
projects/<project-name>/
├── <project-name>.md          ← project overview (named after the project, NOT _project.md)
├── concepts/                  ← project-specific ideas, architectures
├── skills/                    ← project-specific how-tos, patterns
└── references/                ← project-specific source summaries
```

The overview page (`<project-name>.md`) should have:
- What the project is (one paragraph)
- Key concepts and how they connect
- Links to project-specific and global wiki pages

### Global knowledge

Things that aren't project-specific go in the global categories:

| What you found | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| A general concept learned | `concepts/` |
| A reusable pattern or technique | `skills/` |
| A tool/service/person | `entities/` |
| Cross-project analysis | `synthesis/` |

### Page format

Every page needs YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: >-
    Page Title
category: concepts
tags: [tag1, tag2]
sources: [projects/<project-name>]
summary: >-
    One or two sentences (≤200 chars) describing what this page covers.
provenance:
  extracted: 0.6
  inferred: 0.35
  ambiguous: 0.05
base_confidence: 0.59
lifecycle: draft
lifecycle_changed: TIMESTAMP_DATE
created: TIMESTAMP
updated: TIMESTAMP
---

Use folded scalar syntax (summary: >-) for title and summary to keep frontmatter parser-safe across punctuation (:, #, quotes) without escaping rules.
Keep the title and summary contents indented by two spaces under summary: >-.

# Page Title

- A fact the codebase or a doc actually states.
- A reason the design works this way. ^[inferred]

Use [[wikilinks]] to connect to other pages.
```

**Write a `summary:` frontmatter field** on every new/updated page (1–2 sentences, ≤200 chars), using `>-` folded style. For project sync, a good summary answers "what does this page tell me about the project I wouldn't guess from its title?" This field powers cheap retrieval by `wiki-query`.

**Apply provenance markers** per `llm-wiki` (Provenance Markers section). For project sync specifically:

- **Extracted** — anything visible in the code, config, or a doc/commit message: file structure, dependencies, function signatures, what a file does.
- **Inferred** — *why* a decision was made, design rationale, trade-offs, "the team chose X because Y" — unless a commit message, doc, or ADR states it explicitly.
- **Ambiguous** — when the code and docs disagree, or when there's clearly an in-progress migration with two patterns living side by side.

Compute the rough fractions and write the `provenance:` block on every new/updated page.

### Updating vs creating

- If a page already exists in the vault, **merge** new information into it. Don't create duplicates.
- If you're adding to an existing page, update the `updated` timestamp and add the new source.
- Check `index.md` to see what's already there before creating anything new.

## Step 5: Cross-link

After creating/updating pages:

- Add `[[wikilinks]]` from new pages to existing related pages
- Add `[[wikilinks]]` from existing pages back to the new ones where relevant
- Link the project overview to all project-specific pages and relevant global pages

## Step 6: Update Tracking

### Update ingest ledger (`scripts/manifest.py upsert`)

Add or update this project's entry:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "<project-name>": {
      "source_cwd": "/absolute/path/to/project",
      "last_synced": "TIMESTAMP",
      "last_commit_synced": "abc123f",
      "pages_in_vault": ["projects/<project-name>/<project-name>.md", "..."]
    }
  }
}
```

### Update `index.md`

Add entries for any new pages created.

### Update `log.md`

Append:
```
- [TIMESTAMP] WIKI_UPDATE project=<project-name> pages_updated=X pages_created=Y source_cwd=/path/to/project
```

### Update `hot.md`

Read `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/hot.md` (create from the template in `wiki-ingest` if missing). Rewrite **Recent Activity** with what was just synced — last 3 operations max. Update **Active Threads** if this project is an ongoing focus. Update **Key Takeaways** with the most important architectural insight or decision surfaced during this sync. Update `updated` timestamp.

Write conceptually: "Synced obsidian-wiki — added wiki-capture and wiki-research skills, core new capabilities are autonomous web research and conversation capture."

## Step 7: Refresh QMD Wiki Index

The markdown vault is the source of truth; QMD is only a search index. An empty
`QMD_WIKI_COLLECTION` selects `wiki`.

Run this step only after pages, `.manifest.json`, `index.md`, `log.md`, and `hot.md` have been written. If Step 2 found no meaningful changes and the sync stopped early, do not refresh QMD.

Run the repository maintenance command:

```bash
scripts/qmd-maintain.sh
```

Pending vectors are a reported backlog, not a routine failure. Use the
explicit embedding mode only when requested:

```bash
scripts/qmd-maintain.sh --embed
```

Verify a created or materially updated page by following the exact QMD
retrieval rule in AGENTS.md (Vault retrieval): search first, then pass
the returned docid or source verbatim to `qmd get` / `qmd multi-get`.

Record QMD refresh in the final report as one of:
- `QMD refreshed: update + verified; embeddings pending: N`
- `QMD skipped: qmd CLI unavailable`
- `QMD failed: <short error summary>`

## Tips

- **Be aggressive about merging.** If the project uses React Server Components, don't create a new page if `concepts/react-server-components.md` already exists. Update the existing one and add this project as a source.
- **Consult the tag taxonomy.** Read `$VAULT/_meta/taxonomy.md` if it exists, and use canonical tags.
- **Don't copy code.** Distill the *knowledge*, not the implementation. "This project uses a debounced search pattern with 300ms delay" is useful. Pasting the actual debounce function is not.
- **Project overview is the anchor.** The `<project-name>.md` file is what you'd read to get oriented. Make it good.
